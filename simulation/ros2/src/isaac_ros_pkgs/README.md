# AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) Implementation

This directory contains the implementation for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain using NVIDIA Isaac technologies.

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of five main layers:

1. **Perception Layer**: Hardware-accelerated Visual SLAM using Isaac ROS
2. **Mapping & Localization Layer**: Environment mapping and robot localization
3. **Path Planning & Navigation Layer**: Nav2 adapted for bipedal movement
4. **Simulation Layer**: NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation
5. **Training Layer**: Simulation-to-reality transfer mechanisms

## Prerequisites

- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- ROS2 Humble Hawksbill
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Isaac ROS packages
- Nav2 navigation stack
