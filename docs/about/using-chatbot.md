# Using the Course Assistant (RAG Chatbot)

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course assistant! This AI-powered chatbot uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate answers based on the course content.

## How It Works

The course assistant works by:

1. **Retrieving** relevant content from the course materials (Module 1-4)
2. **Generating** contextual responses based on the retrieved information
3. **Citing** the sources where you can find more detailed information

## Getting Started

The chatbot is available on every page of the course. Look for the chat icon 💬 in the bottom-right corner of your screen.

1. Click the chat icon to open the assistant panel
2. Type your question about the course content
3. The assistant will search through all course materials and provide a helpful response
4. Sources for the information will be listed so you can explore further

## What You Can Ask

The course assistant can help with:

- Technical concepts (e.g., "Explain ROS 2 nodes and topics")
- Module-specific content (e.g., "How does VSLAM work in Isaac Sim?")
- Practical implementation details (e.g., "Show me how to create a publisher in ROS 2")
- Comparisons between different approaches (e.g., "What's the difference between Gazebo and Unity for simulation?")

## Tips for Better Results

- **Be specific**: Instead of asking "Explain robotics," try "Explain ROS 2 communication patterns"
- **Ask for examples**: You can request practical examples for any concept
- **Follow up**: Ask "Can you elaborate on that?" or "Show me the code for that?"
- **Navigate to sources**: Check the provided source links for deeper understanding

## Limitations

- The assistant only has access to the course content
- For questions outside the course scope, it will inform you
- Responses are generated based on available documents, so complex multi-step processes might need additional reference to the original materials

## Troubleshooting

If the assistant doesn't provide helpful responses:

1. Try rephrasing your question
2. Make your question more specific
3. Check if the topic is covered in the course modules
4. Ensure your internet connection is stable for the API calls

## Privacy & Data

The assistant does not store your conversations personally. Only anonymous usage analytics are collected to improve the system.
