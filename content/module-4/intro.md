# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4, where we explore Vision-Language-Action models that enable your humanoid robot to understand and execute complex commands based on visual and linguistic input.

In this module, you will learn:
- Understanding VLA architectures
- Implementing voice-to-action systems
- Developing cognitive planning capabilities
- Integrating VLA models with robot control
- Working on the capstone project

Let's build an intelligent interface that allows natural interaction with your humanoid robot.
