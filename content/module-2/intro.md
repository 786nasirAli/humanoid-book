# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2, where we explore the concept of digital twins for humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity simulation environments.

In this module, you will learn:
- How to create digital twin environments for your humanoid robot
- Setting up Gazebo simulations with realistic physics
- Integrating Unity for advanced visualization
- Sensor emulation techniques
- Building complex environments for testing

Let's begin by exploring the fundamentals of digital twin technology in robotics.
