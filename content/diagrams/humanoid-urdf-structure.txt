Key Components:
- Links: (names in parentheses) represent rigid bodies
- Joints: Connections allowing relative movement between links
- Fixed Joints: No movement allowed (e.g., torso to neck)
- Revolute Joints: Single-axis rotation (e.g., shoulder, elbow, hip, knee)
- Kinematic Tree: Torso as central body with limbs as branches

This structure allows ROS 2 controllers to understand the robot's 
physical configuration and coordinate movement across all joints.
