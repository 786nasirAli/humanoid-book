Communication Patterns:
- Sensor data flows via Topics to perception nodes
- High-level commands flow via Services/Actions to controllers
- State information is shared via Topics among all nodes
- Feedback loops maintain balance and coordination

This diagram shows how information flows through a humanoid robot's ROS 2-based nervous system, from sensors in the head and limbs to the central processing and back to actuators.
