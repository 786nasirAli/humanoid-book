                  ROS 2 Nervous System Architecture
                  =================================

    Perception Layer        Decision Layer          Action Layer
    ================        ==============          ============

   [Camera Node]              [AI Agent]           [Motor Ctrl 1]

                        [ROS 2 Middleware]
                        (Communication Backbone)
                        ======================
                        
    Nodes communicate via:
    - Topics (pub/sub)     Services (req/resp)     Actions (with feedback)
    [Sensor Data]         [Configuration]           [Long Tasks]
    [State Updates]       [Calibration]             [Navigation]
    [Vision Data]         [Mode Changes]            [Manipulation]
```

This represents how ROS 2 functions as the nervous system of a robot, with the middleware acting as the communication backbone connecting perception, decision-making, and action layers.
